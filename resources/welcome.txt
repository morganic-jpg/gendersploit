 Welcome to Gendersploit! This “program” emulates the style of popular
 hacking recipe builders such as Metasploit, which provides lists of 
 vulnerabilities and possible exploits for a specified target. The 
 purpose of this here is to draw attention to the similarities between
 hacking practices, and the practices that trans people use to make
 gender through various means. One very common way that trans people 
 make gender is by taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which 
 requires referrals, a lot of waiting, psychiatric assessments/
 evaluations/diagnoses, and conforming to hegemonic and binary 
 conceptions of transition. Because of this, the trans community 
 spends a lot of time sharing experiences and methods for dealing with
 the difficult medico-legal systems that they have to navigate. These
 instructions seek to explain the process of making exploits in the
 context of gender, transition, and hormone assessments to explain the
 knowledge (and hack) sharing practices of trans people on the 
 internet.
