                      What Are Gender Exploits?

 At their base, exploits are tools for acting and experimenting with
 your environment, and in the case of transition, your gender, body,
 expression, identity and so on. It may be useful to think of gender
 exploits as having different sites, for example, taking hormones can
 be understood as a way of exploiting the way that you are perceived 
 or the way you perceive yourself through materially hacking your own
 body. Alternatively, a gender exploit could have more to do with how
 you identify yourself to the law and healthcare providers, this could
 be seen as having a medico-legal site rather than a bodily one. 
 However, all gender exploits and gender hacking entail both of these
 things, and it is important to keep that in mind while thinking about
 how to navigate anything ranging from how you dress to gender
 dysphoria diagnosis and beyond. Thinking with / making exploits are a
 particularly useful tool for the trans community because being trans
 almost always goes against the grain, and it is very useful to share
 methods for slipping through the cracks or simply just existing in
 systems that want to squish you and your transness. 

                  How Do You Make Gender Exploits?

 Possible ways of making/creating/practicing gender are infinite, 
 nevertheless, it is useful to develop methods/exploits for making
 (or hacking) gender that can help others navigate difficult 
 situations like acquiring/using hormones. Reworking the above 
 instructions for creating exploits, here are some for creating 
 gender exploits:

   1.  Learn about the strengths and weaknesses of social and 
       medico-legal conceptions of sex/gender.
       e.g. sexual dimorphism, the gender binary, patriarchy.

   2.  Learn how others have overcome the limitations of these ideas 
       and the social and medico-legal systems which perpetuate them. 
       e.g. gender non-conformity. 

   3.  Think of ways that you can use this information to better 
       navigate (and exploit) the relevant systems. 
       e.g. studying diagnostic criteria before a hormone assessment

   4.  Experiment with different gender exploits and don’t be afraid
       to change your mind or change your goals, methods, practices. 
       e.g. experimenting with gender presentation and seeing what 
       works, and what certain people notice or don’t notice.
