 
                         What Are Exploits?

 Exploits are a core practice of hacking; exploits are tools/methods/
 practices which are used/executed with the knowledge of
 pre-existing vulnerabilities in a system and with the goal of 
 gaining some kind of advantage. No matter how secure or controlling 
 a system is, there will always be vulnerabilities, and by extension,
 exploits which can be used for the hackerâ€™s benefit. Exploits may
 appear to be executed by individual hackers, but these hackers rely
 on knowledge of vulnerabilities, existing exploits, and other tools
 /practices which they use through instructions, recipe builders or
 community knowledge. However, hacking is something that is different
 every time, and often requires the hacker to make different
 exploits or hybridize existing ones.

                      How Do You Make Exploits?

 The process of making exploits will be different for every person and
 every making-exploit, but it is still beneficial to list the general 
 stages of how exploits are made:

   1.  Learn about the strengths and weaknesses (vulnerabilities)
       of the system you wish to exploit.

   2.  Learn how others have overcome, circumvented, and exploited
       these strengths and weaknesses in the past.

   3.  Craft your own plan of action for executing (or not) methods
       for exploiting the weaknesses and strengths of the system.

   4.  Experiment using your exploits and change your understandings,
       practices, and methods as you interact with the environment 
       and its responses (including yours!)
